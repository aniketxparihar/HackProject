# Tabfi

A thoughtful productive app to give your browser a colorful update.

Tabfi is a general-purpose new tab extension tailored especially for new-age developers who like to be productive.
Tabfi boasts of several intuitive features like notes, todos, Pomodoro, bookmarks, Project Management, and even Lofi!!.

Why we decided to make this our Hackathon Submissions?
We have been making projects for 4 months in neogCamp and
we figured out that jumping from one project to another was hindering our focus.
If only we had all our productivity features in one place and also had all our dev data
in one single place.
Our motivation was simply to make our life easier in the rest of the camp and beyond.
